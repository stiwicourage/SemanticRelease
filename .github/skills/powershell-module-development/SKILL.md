# Skill: PowerShell module development

## When to use

Use this skill when changing public commands, private helpers, CLI routing support, packaging behavior, or project.json resolution.

## Relevant files

- `src/public/*.ps1`
- `src/private/build/`
- `src/private/cli/`
- `src/private/package/`
- `src/private/release/`
- `src/private/shared/`
- `project.json`
- `tests/*Command*.Tests.ps1`
- `tests/*Architecture*.Tests.ps1`

## Expected practices

- Keep public commands thin and delegating.
- Put implementation detail in the correct private domain folder.
- Treat `project.json` as the source of truth for Nova build, package, manifest, and release metadata.
- Read `project.json` `Manifest.PowerShellHostVersion` before changing PowerShell code, tests, or examples, and keep new work compatible with that target. A `5.1` project must not receive PowerShell 7.x-only syntax, cmdlets, parameters, or APIs unless the change explicitly adds guarded compatibility handling.
- Do not create or maintain hand-written module `.psm1` or module `.psd1` files in source; Nova generates those files under `dist/SemanticRelease/`.
- Preserve native PowerShell semantics. Keep Nova naming patterns on public commands, and give private helpers clear implementation-focused names instead of public-style `Invoke-SVR*`, `Get-SVR*`, or `Update-SVR*` naming.
- Keep one externally called function per file and match the file name to that function. In `src/private/`, a file may contain additional top-level functions only when those functions are called exclusively by the file's primary entry function and are not referenced from any other file. If a helper is called from more than one file, extract it into its own same-named file. Do not declare functions inside functions.
- Use `.github/instructions/code-quality-matrix.instructions.md` as the authoritative source-code maintainability guidance. Apply all of its rules to new or heavily changed code. Keep that code short, single-purpose, low-duplication, lightly nested, and split by clear responsibility; group related inputs instead of growing long parameter lists.
- Reuse existing workflow-context helpers and shared adapters.
- Follow the repository's PowerShell style rules: 4-space indentation, same-line opening braces, restrained blank lines, full cmdlet names, and readable operator spacing.
- Follow `.github/instructions/psscriptanalyzer.instructions.md` as the ScriptAnalyzer workflow source of truth. Prefer `./scripts/build/Invoke-ScriptAnalyzerCI.ps1` and the repository quality loop, when present, and use direct `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` only for focused local checks or deliberate analyzer-tooling work.
- Keep ScriptAnalyzer strict: do not add excluded rules, suppression attributes, or settings that hide analyzer findings.
- Keep local quality checks ordered as ScriptAnalyzer first, then `Invoke-NovaBuild`, then `Invoke-NovaTest`, then `Test-NovaBuild` when the project defines a combined wrapper.
- If the repository quality loop or `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzerCI.ps1` reports ScriptAnalyzer findings, fix them before handoff instead of just reporting the failure. If a finding appears to be a false positive or conflicts with a rule explicitly required by this prompt, document the conflict in a code comment and escalate to the human reviewer instead of adding a suppression attribute or excluding the rule.
- Before handoff, review every source text file you created or modified under `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, and `scripts/` and normalize it to exactly one trailing newline with no extra blank lines at the end. Do not modify files under `dist/` or any file you did not directly change.
- Add or update valid PlatyPS-compatible help under `docs/SemanticRelease/en-US/` when public commands or public classes change. Use this order:
	1. Build the module with `Invoke-NovaBuild`.
	2. Import the built module with `Import-Module ./dist/SemanticRelease/SemanticRelease.psd1 -Force`.
	3. Run `New-MarkdownCommandHelp` for new commands or `Update-MarkdownCommandHelp` for existing ones.
	4. Verify that `external help file` and `Module Name` reference the module name, not the command name.
	5. Run `Test-MarkdownCommandHelp` on all affected help files and fix any reported issues before handoff.
- For every new public `src/public/*.ps1` file, create the matching help file immediately in the same change.
- Add or update the source-mirrored Pester test file for every changed `src/**/*.ps1` file. Source-mirrored test files for private helpers live under `tests/private/<domain>/<HelperName>.Tests.ps1`, mirroring the `src/private/<domain>/` folder structure. Use the same `Describe` block name as the function under test. If no existing test file exists for a private helper you are changing, create it with at least one `Context` block covering the primary success path.
- For public commands, keep unit coverage in `tests/public/<Command>.Tests.ps1` and keep per-command integration ownership in `tests/public/<Command>.Integration.Tests.ps1` when built-module behavior itself needs validation.
- For destructive or environment-coupled public commands, prefer safe `-WhatIf` integration coverage when that still proves `ShouldProcess`, routing, and output behavior.

## Common pitfalls

- Adding more than one top-level function to a public file
- Mixing CLI flag spellings into PowerShell command output
- Calling `git`, `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Update-Module`, or `$env:` from the wrong layer
- Replacing explicit warning opt-ins with generic force semantics
- Creating a root module `.psm1` or module manifest `.psd1` by hand instead of letting Nova generate them from `project.json`
- Grouping two private helpers in one file when both are referenced from outside that file instead of splitting them into separate same-named files
- Declaring helper functions inside another function instead of keeping related private helpers as sibling top-level functions in the file
- Ignoring the source-code guidance and letting new or heavily changed functions grow long, deeply nested, duplicated, or multi-purpose without justification
- Writing plain Markdown under `docs/SemanticRelease/en-US/` that lacks YAML metadata or the PlatyPS structure expected by `Import-MarkdownCommandHelp`
- Editing PlatyPS YAML and section structure by hand when `New-MarkdownCommandHelp` or `Update-MarkdownCommandHelp` should have regenerated it
- Generating help markdown without the built module imported, which causes `external help file` to default to the command name and produces per-command XML files instead of a single `<ModuleName>-Help.xml`
- Adding a new public entry point without the matching help file in `docs/SemanticRelease/en-US/`
- Bypassing the repository analyzer wrapper/settings with ad hoc `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer`, `-EnableExit`, or broad rule-exclusion changes
- Ignoring the project's `Manifest.PowerShellHostVersion` target and introducing PowerShell 7.x-only features into a `5.1` project
- Excluding PSScriptAnalyzer rules instead of fixing the code that violates them

## Verification

- Run `Invoke-NovaTest` for any change under `src/` or `tests/`.
- Run `Test-NovaBuild` additionally when a public command signature changed, packaging or manifest metadata changed, or integration tests were added or modified.
- Run `tests/*Architecture*.Tests.ps1` for any structural change, including new files, renamed files, or changed function names.
- Always run `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File ./run.ps1` as the final gate before handoff.
