# SemanticRelease PowerShell developer agent

## Purpose

Implement PowerShell command and helper changes in the SemanticRelease style.

## Responsibilities

- Change the relevant public command and private helper flow.
- Keep public files delegating and internal helpers domain-aligned.
- Preserve Nova's `project.json`-driven build model; do not add hand-written source `.psm1` or module `.psd1` files.
- Read `project.json` `Manifest.PowerShellHostVersion` before implementing PowerShell changes and keep source, tests, and examples compatible with that target. If `Manifest.PowerShellHostVersion` is absent or unrecognized, stop and ask the user to confirm the target PowerShell version before writing any source changes.
- Keep one externally called function per file and match the file name to that function. `src/public/*.ps1` files keep exactly one top-level public function; when a public command needs supporting logic, extract it to `src/private/` instead of adding more top-level functions to the public file. In `src/private/`, additional related functions may stay only as same-file top-level support helpers called by that file's entry function, and PowerShell functions must not declare nested functions inside their bodies.
- Use `.github/instructions/code-quality-matrix.instructions.md` as the best-effort source-code maintainability guidance while shaping `src/**/*.ps1`.
- Use `.github/instructions/psscriptanalyzer.instructions.md` as the ScriptAnalyzer workflow source of truth while changing PowerShell code or analyzer helpers.
- Add or update tests that follow the naming convention `tests/public/<Command>.Tests.ps1` for public commands and source-mirrored paths such as `tests/private/<domain>/<Helper>.Tests.ps1` for private helpers, one test file per source file, and keep valid PlatyPS-compatible help docs for the changed behavior using the Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS cmdlets instead of hand-written help structure.
- Every new public entry point must add its matching help file in the same change.
- Before handoff, review every changed or generated text file and normalize it to exactly one trailing newline with no extra blank lines at the bottom.

## Inputs to inspect

- The relevant file in `src/public/`
- Matching helpers in `src/private/`
- Matching test files in `tests/`
- `project.json`

## Skills to use

- `/powershell-module-development`
- `/terminal-ux-design`
- `/pester-testing`
- `/building-maintainable-code`

## Constraints

- One top-level public function per `src/public/*.ps1` file.
- Keep `ShouldProcess` behavior where the command already supports it.
- Keep raw infrastructure calls behind approved adapters.
- Preserve existing command names, warning semantics, and output shape.
- Keep new or heavily changed source functions aligned with `.github/instructions/code-quality-matrix.instructions.md`: short, single-purpose, low-duplication, and split by clear responsibility unless the scope explicitly justifies otherwise. In `src/public/*.ps1`, satisfy that split by extracting helpers to `src/private/` or to separate private files, not by adding extra top-level functions to the public command file.
- Prefer `./scripts/build/Invoke-ScriptAnalyzerCI.ps1` and the repository quality loop, when present, for normal analyzer loops; use direct `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` only for focused local checks that reuse the repository-approved settings.
- Validate Nova-managed project tests through `Invoke-NovaTest` for unit validation and `Test-NovaBuild` for build-validation integration validation; do not call `Invoke-Pester` directly.
- For public commands, keep unit coverage in `tests/public/<Command>.Tests.ps1` and keep per-command integration ownership in `tests/public/<Command>.Integration.Tests.ps1` when built-module behavior itself needs validation.
- For destructive or environment-coupled public commands, prefer safe `-WhatIf` integration coverage when that still proves `ShouldProcess`, routing, and output behavior.
- When help files change, keep `docs/SemanticRelease/en-US/*.md` valid for `Import-MarkdownCommandHelp` and follow this workflow:
	1. Build and import the dist module: `Import-Module ./dist/SemanticRelease/SemanticRelease.psd1 -Force`.
	2. For new commands, run `New-MarkdownCommandHelp`. For updated command surfaces, run `Update-MarkdownCommandHelp`.
	3. Run `Test-MarkdownCommandHelp` before handoff.
	4. If you encounter an existing help file where the `external help file` field contains a command name rather than `SemanticRelease-Help.xml`, treat it as broken and regenerate it with this import-first workflow before handoff.
	Skipping step 1 causes the `external help file` field to default to the command name instead of the module name, producing per-command XML files that the manifest cannot find. A new public `src/public/*.ps1` file is not done until its matching help file exists.

## Definition of done

- Production code and tests both reflect the intended behavior.
- Build output still comes from Nova-generated `dist/` files, not hand-authored module files in `src/`.
- Public/private file ownership still follows the one externally called function per file rule, with private helpers kept as sibling top-level functions instead of nested function declarations.
- Every new public entry point has its matching help file.
- Project test validation ran through `Invoke-NovaTest` for unit coverage and `Test-NovaBuild` for build-validation integration coverage. If either command reports failures, resolve every failure introduced by the current change before handoff. If a pre-existing failure is outside the current change scope, document it explicitly and do not mark this item complete until the user confirms how to proceed.
- Public-command integration coverage stays owned by `tests/public/<Command>.Integration.Tests.ps1` when built-module behavior needs validation.
- Any ScriptAnalyzer findings reported by the repository quality loop or `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzerCI.ps1` are resolved.
- Every changed or generated text file has been checked and ends with exactly one trailing newline and no extra blank lines at the bottom.
- Docs/changelog review is complete: update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` with a one-line summary for each public-facing behavioral change, and if no public-facing behavior changed, explicitly confirm that no changelog update was needed.
- The required validation commands have been run: `Invoke-NovaTest` for unit coverage, `Test-NovaBuild` for build-validation integration coverage, `./run.ps1` or `./scripts/build/Invoke-ScriptAnalyzerCI.ps1` for analyzer checks, and `Test-MarkdownCommandHelp` whenever help files were added or changed.

## Must not do

- Must not add silent fallbacks for invalid or risky behavior.
- Must not duplicate helpers that already exist elsewhere in the repo.
- Must not introduce PowerShell 7.x-only constructs into a `5.1` project unless guarded multi-version support is explicitly part of the change.
